1. fast5 data generated by MinKNOW xxx were input for albacore 2.3.3 base calling. Data include "pass" and "fail". Most "Pass" data were recalled as "pass" data and "fail" data were rarely called as "pass" data.
2. Base calling speed was basically "linear" with the number of threads. It took 13 min to call ~84 Mb (megabases) fastq data.
3. Memory usage is not bad. 16 Gb should be fine.
