Scanning overlap files to count the number of overlaps.
Found 0.027 million overlaps.
Memory limit 1024MB supplied.  I'll put 1002416 IIDs (53.69 million overlaps) into each of 1 buckets.

bucketizing DONE!
overlaps skipped:
               0 OBT - low quality
               0 DUP - non-duplicate overlap
               0 DUP - different library
               0 DUP - dedup not requested
